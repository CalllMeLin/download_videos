# download_videos
This is an application that uses PySimpleGUI, re, pytube, PIL and urllib to download video Thumbnails and the audio of the video itself.
When you open it, it'll ask you to choose a name for a file. Please choose different names for each file, and change the name BEFORE you click on the download Button.
If you have any ideas to improve Cuto Downloader, let me know :]
